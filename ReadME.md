# Windows Event Forwarding (WEF) & Windows Event Collector (WEC) Configuration Guide

## Overview
Windows Event Forwarding (WEF) and Windows Event Collector (WEC) allow organizations to centralize Windows event logs for better security monitoring, incident response, and compliance. This guide provides a step-by-step setup to configure WEF and WEC properly.

## Prerequisites
### System Requirements
- **Windows Server** (for WEC)
- **Windows Clients** (for WEF)
- **Active Directory** (for domain-based deployment)
- **Group Policy Management** (to configure forwarding policies)
- **Domain Admin privileges** (recommended for setup)

### Network & Security Configurations
- Enable **WinRM (Windows Remote Management)** on all endpoints
- Ensure firewall rules allow event log forwarding
- WEC server must be trusted by the domain
<br><br><br>
## On Windows Server (WEC Machine)

1. Enable the service “Windows Event Collector”

    Firstly, we should enable “Windows Event Collector” service in Services tab. 

    Change the Startup type to the `Automatic (Delayed Start)`

2. **Add the network service account to the domain**
    1. In `Active Directory Users and Computers`, go to the **`Builtin`** folder and double-click **`Event Log Readers`**.
    2. Select **`Members`**.
    3. If **Network Service** is not listed, select **Add**, and then enter **Network Service**.
    4. Select **Check Names** and select **OK** twice.

3. Configure WinRM 
    1. Run these commands on Powershell as Administrator
    
        ```bash
        winrm quickconfig 
        wecutil qc
        ```
    

        ![image.png](Images/image29.png)

4. Create Custom Event Providers (Optional)
    1. Move these files to your system32 folder and run the following command:
        
        `wevtutil im C:\Windows\System32\WEF_Events.man` 
        
    
        ![image.png](Images/image%202.png)
    
        After running this command the following channels must be created under the `WEF-Events` in the Event Viewer. I have chosen this channels for test purposes and also tried to choose the most used Event types. If you want to customize it, you can refer [here](https://github.com/jebidiah-anthony/Windows-Event-Forwarder/blob/master/Creating%20Custom%20Logs.md).

5. Apply GPO to config Agents
    1. Enable WINRM on Agents
        1. On the right side, locate and modify the **Allow remote server management through WinRM** policy setting.
            
            ![image.png](Images/image%204.png)
            
            Set to Enabled and add the “*” to both IPv4 and IPv6 filter.
            
            ![image.png](Images/image%205.png)
            
        2. The next policy that needs to be configured is the one responsible for enabling and starting the WinRM service. Expand **Computer Configuration >  Preferences > Control Panel Settings > Services**. Right-click the **Services** section and choose **New > Service**.
            
            ![image.png](Images/image%206.png)
            
        3. The final policy we need to configure for WinRM to function is opening the appropriate **Firewall** ports. Expand **Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security > Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security > Inbound** **Rules**. Right-click the **Inbound Rules** section and choose **New Rule**.
            
            ![image.png](Images/image%207.png)
            
            On the **New Inbound Rule Wizard** click **Predefined** then from the list select **Windows Remote Management**.
            
            ![image.png](Images/image%208.png)
            
            In the **Predefined Rules** window, ensure that the **Public profile** box is unchecked. While this doesn’t expose you to the internet—since your company already has a firewall in place—it is considered a best practice.
            
            ![image.png](Images/image%209.png)
            
            Proceed with the default option by allowing the connection.
            
            ![image.png](Images/image%2010.png)
            
        GPO settings for double check:

        - “Enable Winrm”     
          - Firewall:
            
            ![image.png](Images/image%2011.png)
        
          - WinRM Service:
        
            ![image.png](Images/image%2012.png)
        
            ![image.png](Images/image%2013.png)
            
    2.  Add `Network Service` account to the Agents’ Local Group
        
        ![image.png](Images/image%2014.png)
        
        ![image.png](Images/image%2015.png)
        
        Then add `Network Service` user to the group. Double click the `OK` and then click `Apply` button.
        
        ![image.png](Images/image%2016.png)
        
        “Add `Network Service` account to the Agents’ Local Group” — GPO settings - for double check:
        
        ![image.png](Images/image%2017.png)
        
    3. Then run `gpupdate.exe` on PowerShell as Administrator or reboot the clients to take effect.  
    

1. Configure a Subscription
    1. **Collector Initiated** - In this method, WEC server will connect to the agents and collect events with privileged user. 
        - In the Event Viewer, Click the `Subscriptions` (on the bottom)
        - Click the `Create Subscription`
  
            ![alt text](Images\image27.png)

        - Choose relevant Destination Log
            
            ![image.png](Images/image%2018.png)
            
        - Add domain computers
            
            ![image.png](Images/image%2019.png)
            
            After clicking OK you can check also the connectivity. 
            
            ![image.png](Images/image%2020.png)
            
        - Selecting Relevant Events
            
            ![image.png](Images/image%2021.png)
            
        
        - Specifying the privileged account
            
            Triple click the `OK` button.
            
            ![image.png](Images/image%2022.png)
            
        - Check the runtime status
            - Click the Right button of the mouse on the subscription and check the status of the Subscription.
            ![image.png](Images/image%2023.png)
            <br><br><br>
    2. **Source Initiated** -- In this method, all agents send events to the WEC Server
        
        For this config we should do some extra staff. 
        
        1. Firstly, run these commands in the PowerShell (WEC Server):
            
            ```bash
            netsh http delete urlacl url=http://+:5985/wsman/
            
            netsh http add urlacl url=http://+:5985/wsman/ sddl="D:(A;;GX;;;S-1-5-80-569256582-2953403351-2909559716-1301513147-412116970)(A;;GX;;;S-1-5-80-4059739203-877974739-1245631912-527174227-2996563517)"
            ```
            
        2. Then add GPO to enable Subscription manager on agents.
            
            **Computer Configuration > Policies > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Event Forwarding**
            
            Add this value:
            
            `Server=http://dc.siem.local:5985/wsman/SubscriptionManager/WEC,Refresh=10` 
            
            ![image.png](Images/image%2024.png)
            
            Click `OK` and then `Apply` button. Here you should specify the WEC server FQDN (In my case I have used DC you can use another server) 
            
        3. Now you can create the source based Subscriptions
            1. This is the same process with the (6. — a.) but here we choose `Source Computer initiated.` 
                
                ![image.png](Images/image%2025.png)
                
                You can add desired OUs here. And no need to specify the privileged account credentials in this solution.  
                
            
        <br><br>
    After creating Subscription you can check the connected Agents status by checking `Runtime Status`
    <br><br>![image.png](Images/image%2026.png)

        After a while all logs will start to come your specified destinations.
